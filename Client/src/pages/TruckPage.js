        description:
          'Known as Ji mmiri oku (meaning yam in hot water), the yam pepper soup is prepared with lots of different fish from stock fish to smoked fish to fresh fish and dried crayfish. All of these you can find at the African market or just order off Amazon. I would tell you though, that the ones from the local African markets are tastier, from my personal experience. The active ingredient that gives this dish its flavor and is known to helping sterilize the womb by flushing out the lochia postpartum and aiding in faster healing, is known as Uda. It is also known as Hwentia, Grains of Selim, Xylopia Aethiopica, Uda Spice, Diarr, Uda Seed, negro pepper (bruh, I low key feel like this one is offensive ngl üòÇ)... Anyways, it has a ton of names, I think you get that now. Uda is sometimes crushed and used topically to treat skin infections like boils, rashes and sores. Pepper soup spice also contains Uziza seeds (African black pepper or Piper Guineese), which provide medicinal, intestinal, culinary and dietary benefits. Uziza is used in a number of herbs to treat everything from male fertility to shrinking fibroids, to warding off insects, to increasing contraction of uterine walls during childbirth, rheumatism, diabetes, hypertension, to improve appetite, diarrhea, menstrual cramps. And because it is a powerful anti-oxidant, it is used in native medicine to shrink and destroy cancerous cells, cysts and tumors. While Uziza is safe for pregnant women, I wouldn‚Äôt advise pregnant women to consume Uda, as it is counter productive since it is used for cleaning out the womb. Sometimes yam pepper soup is made with ‚ÄúAju Mbaise‚Äù (Meaning a wrap from Mbaise), which is a local herb of the Mbaise people of Imo state in Eastern Nigeria and is most known to aid in losing pregnancy weight. It is a combination of ginger roots, uziza seeds, Uda, and the Aju bark found on a medicinal tree local to Mbaise. Asides all the health benefits of these ingredients, it is a tasty dish that can be enjoyed at anytime.',

We really liked the spices! It`s not very often that you find food that prepared with such care. We had the two middle sauces as well ("give me spicy" and "maybe a little spicy"), and they complemented well the dish. They do have a kick - we like spicy, but normally we are reluctant to ask for the super hot dishes in restaurants with traditionally spicy cuisines. I think we made the right choice of sauces. They were tasty and had the right amount of heat. Not only the food, but the service was also great. We ordered via SMS and Wendy was super responsive. The food was ready at the time promised, and easy to pick up. She also made sure that everything was right and that we liked it. We`ll definitely come back for more sometime...',

        'I JUST HAD THE BEST FOOD I EVER TASTED IN AMERICA, AND YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT IT!!!! I moved out here from London and I struggled with eating out because most of the food in my opinion, were mostly bland. I`m Nigerian, and so when I saw that there was a new Nigerian food delivery service opening up, I thought I would try it just for the sake of having a taste of home (and also the owner and I share the same name, so I thought I`d support) I am happy to report that I WAS BLOWN AWAY BY THE FOOD. Everyone that knows me knows how much of a picky eater I am. I have never left a review for anything ever, but this food was too good not to share with the world. It was even better than most of what I had back home in Nigeria. It is tasty, the chicken is yummy and it was the perfect definition of home-cooked meal. I am definitely placing another order, and hopefully the owner Wendy would have a subscription model soon so I could start making weekly subscriptions. Best part is she even caters! Guys!!! And the portions are very generous. She makes custom orders in case you are curious about any Nigerian foods that is not on her menu. I AM IN THE CLOUDS!!! It should be illegal for food to taste that good! Okay I`ll stop now. Lol. But you should check it out. I`ve attached a copy of the menu. You can call, text or email to place your order. And please let me know what you think when you do try it. P.S Couldn`t even take pictures of my food, ate it so fast lol!',

And I loved the jollof rice too. Wendy is a delight and willing to make what you want. I can hardly wait to try the pepper chicken. Dale',

Everyone in the family had their favorites. I`m were the jollop quinoa and the fried rice. We went with the Little bit of spice for the chicken and it was very flavorful with just a bit of zing.

        'The food is FANTASTIC. My wife and I ordered one each of the two main rice and chicken entrees and six pieces of the pepper chicken to share, along with three of the sauces, and all of it was excellent. The chicken was juicy and everything was fresh, delectably seasoned and affordably priced (especially for this area and with the generous portions). The dishes are simultaneously restaurant quality but clearly made with the same care as homemade. I`m a big hot sauce/spicy food fan while my wife is less fond of heat, and we were both hugely satisfied with the options we ordered. Highly recommend.',
