## **_General Overview_**

A full stack web app that maps out all the foodtrucks available at a theme park, their location, menu and how to purchase each menu item from each food truck.

## **_App Outlook_**

#### The page opens up with a full home page that that displays a nav bar, which contains the `AboutPage`, `HomePage` and `TruckPage`.

<br>

### The About Page

#### This page gives a detailed description of our app and all of its components.

<br>

### The Home Page

#### The Home renders a `map` of the entire theme park, which pinpoints the location of each food truck within the park.

<br>

### The Truck page

#### Once a foodtruck is clicked on the `map` displayed on the `HomePage`, it, the app automatically loads the `TruckPage`, which renders the `Truck` component and the `Review` for the foodtruck. The `Truck` page renders the `Menu` for that foodtruck, and each menu `Item` that shows the price per item, a cart and a checkout counter.

#### When an `Item` on the `Menu` is selected, the cart is updated with the number of items selected. The user can then select "CheckOut" from the bottom of the page

<br>

#### We would be adding a conditional rendering to open the `Receipt` pafe if the user clicks on the "CheckOut button. The `Receipt` page would then render a `postReview` page that allows the customers post an optional review on that foodtruck.

## **_Future Updates_**

#### After completing this project we would like to add many more capabilities, including the functionalities below:

- Update and add trucks across the map
- Develop buying capabilities
- Create an owner login to update, add, or delete their own trucks
- Allow users to leave comments about specific food items
- Develop the map further
